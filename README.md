# ChatApp : Introduction
Welcome to the ChatApp project! This repository contains the codebase for a modern chat application built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The application supports individual messaging, group messaging, and file sharing, providing a robust and feature-rich platform for real-time communication.

## Features
 * Real-time Messaging: Instantly send and receive messages.
 * Group Chats: Create and manage group conversations.
 * File Sharing: Share images, documents, and other files within chats.
 * User Authentication: Secure user login

### Technology Stack
- Backend (Node.js + Express)
The backend server handles user authentication, stores user data, and manages API endpoints for the chat functionality.

 Key Files
* index.js: Sets up the Express app and starts the server.
* request.rest: Contains API requests for testing endpoints.
* package.json: Lists the backend dependencies.
- Frontend (React + Chat Engine + Vite)
The frontend is built with React and integrates with Chat Engine for real-time messaging capabilities. Vite is used as the build tool for faster development.

 Key Files
* App.jsx: Main component that sets up routing.
* AuthPage.jsx: Component for user authentication (login/register).
* ChatsPage.jsx: Component for displaying and managing chat rooms.
* App.css: Styling for the application.
* index.html: Main HTML file.
* vite.config.js: Vite configuration file.
* package.json: Lists the frontend dependencies
